We are proud to announce the release of Parrot 4.2.

It was a very problematic release for our team because of the many important updates under the hood of a system that looks almost identical to its previous release, except for a new background designed by Federica Maras√† and a new graphic theme (ARK-Dark).

## Updated kernel and core packages

Parrot 4.2 is powered by the latest **Linux 4.18** debianized kernel with all the usual wireless patches.

A new version of the **Debian-Installer** now powers our netinstall images and the standard Parrot images.

**Firmware packages** were updated to add broader hardware support, including **wireless devices and AMD vega graphics**

**AppArmor and Firejail** profiles were adjusted to offer a good compromise of security and usability for most of the desktop and CLI applications and services

## New documentation portal

We are working to drop our previous DokuWiki documentation portal and replace it with a full static documentation portal written in markdown which would be easier to maintain through our GIT server.

The new documentation portal can be visited [here https://www.parrotsec.org/docs](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs). feel free to contribute and expand our documentation by sending us a push request on [https://dev.parrotsec.org/parrot/documentation.](https://dev.parrotsec.org/parrot/documentation)
